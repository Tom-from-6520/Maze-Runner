What this project does
This project is an algorithm for mBot by MakeBlock to solve a maze. Created in Arduino IDE with C and open-source libraries from MakeBlock, the algorithm allow an mBot to go through a maze with just one ultrasonic sensor upfront to measure the distance.

The project uses
Created in Arduino IDE and uses MakeBlock open-source libraries

Impressive points
It is a recursive algorithm without memorization, but it still can solve the maze effectively and uses minimum memory.
